# aoc2019
Advent of Code is an event run by Eric Wastl. For each day leading up to Christmas, programmers are tasked with solving two small problems each day.

Solutions can be run by building the project with <pre><code>stack build</code></pre>
and then running the solution with the command <pre><code>stack exec aoc2019-exe [day] [input file]</code></pre>
